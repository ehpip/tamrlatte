              From Desert Tradition to Modern Delight
            </h3>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              TamrLatte was born from ancient Middle Eastern traditions, where dates have been a staple food for millennia. Our founder, while traveling through date palm oases, discovered locals blending fresh dates with milkâ€”a combination that was both refreshingly simple and profoundly satisfying.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Inspired by this discovery, we set out to perfect a recipe that would capture the essence of this traditional beverage while meeting modern nutritional standards. After years of careful experimentation with date varieties and milk sources, TamrLatte was born.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Today, we source the finest Medjool dates and combine them with creamy, high-quality milk to create a beverage that honors its origins while providing a natural energy boost for today's busy lifestyles.
